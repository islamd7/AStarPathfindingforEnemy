# Unity A* Pathfinding

This project includes a simple implementation of the A* (A-star) pathfinding algorithm for Unity. It allows game objects or AI agents to find the shortest path between two points while avoiding obstacles.

The project is ideal for learning and experimenting with basic game AI and navigation systems in Unity.

This project is early version of my first big game project.
